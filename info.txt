TODO: 
- theming
- logging
- add package scope (might look like a folder between project and file)
- search
- rerun last
- Option to rescan for tests / should this happen on a timer??
- Create/modify config in app
- smaller results panel below results that has meta data and logs??
- some ui impovement to change screen when rerunning test
- add results state to test in tree (tick or cross emoji??)

Notes
- Check if it might make more sence to call go test package instead of using os.exec
- check if a tparse integration works better than piping (piping can be made nicer later)

TODO: 
- tree should sort each level alphabetically / or should it remain as seen in the files. e.g the order of test functions and cases matches the actual file
- search qol 
  - fuzzy search is shit, need to look into why. e.g. 
  internal/store/mapper_test.go/Test_toReports will only show up by searching `store/toreport`. searching `toreport` will show unrelated things, how can letter inorder be weighted higher
  - fuzzy find highlight chars input? use ANSI? how do I find each char? wrap fuzzy or postprocess?
  - search should also have a filter e.g 1. files, 2. functions ...
  - matching emojis at the start of the option would be good as well
- console should have drop down for each large field (outputs and errors)
- Adjust config temporarily -> looking at a form of sorts
- Custom themes -> theme file?
- Add results state to test in tree (tick or cross emoji??)
- Add a helper modal that shows all keybindings (for current panel) -> page helpers should also update depending on where the focus is 
- Add focus to results 
  - search 
  - scroll
  - G + gg to top/bottom
  - copy 
- Optimize with concurrency
- Create multiple different types of tests and get them working -> t.Run("static", ...) -> static, map, embeded, ...
- If struct has implicit initialisation test cases won't show up, is there a solution to this?
- take config logic and make it a seperate project with clearer code and reusablity
- dynamic resizing of panels if context is too wide (mainly tree)
- File test (needs a deep dive, seems like easiest way is to run all tests in the file instead of including all deps in test cmd)
- Create my own test result parser??

Bug:
- Scrolling moves out of app? is this all terminals? is this tmux?
- H should close current level and select one above (will need to try this out to see if it feels better)
- config pane is transparent
- What happens if you hit run too many times? How to control ongoing tests.. only one in flight?
- There is a bug to do with how privimatives are listening for key presses. Global keys require to be pressed twice??
- move logs to .local/share/gotex
- TODOs in code
- syncing causes panic

Hacks to look back at:
- If t.Run is called more than once the function is duplicated each with one test case being the name of that call
  -  post processing hack to merge any cases into duplicate functions within a file

Notes:
use charm/log https://github.com/charmbracelet/log
https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go/internal/test make use of `go test -json` then parse the output and clean

use this to cat the subtests: cat internal/jwt/writer_test.go | rg name:

use this to get all the test files fzf --filter _test.go

main components:
  https://github.com/mistakenelf/fm
  sub menus
  test output
  loading animation while tests are running

things to considers:
  When you run a test in a folder somehow update the ui in all submenus to show result with emoji
  Use go.mod as a project point
  Allow unique ways to specify test cases
  allow pre reqs for tests in dir. setup config like docker compose up ...

might be able to have a setup like lazygit where folders are top left, tests are middle left, results are bottom left??
https://github.com/dlvhdr/gh-dash -> could use

Current Tasks:
  - set viewports width and heights
  - navigate between panels

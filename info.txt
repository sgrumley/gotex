TODO: 
1. Write TUI
2. Decide if refactor needed for API
3. Test API code 
4. Logging to file


Upcoming:
- different types for running go test e.g files, pkgs...
- use file tree instead 
- search

Notes
- Check if it might make more sence to call go test package instead of using os.exec

BUGS: 
- initialising set values isn't working properly (panic if you dont change list before you run test case)
- border of pane should change on focus
- better colour theme
- dir names with files
- results pane should keep colors of text

Priority is change to file tree

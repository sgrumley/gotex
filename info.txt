- Adjust config temporarily
- Custom themes
- Add results state to test in tree (tick or cross emoji??)
- Add a helper modal that shows all keybindings (for current panel)
- Add focus to results 
  - search 
  - scroll
  - copy 
- Optimize with concurrency

Bug:
- File test (needs a deep dive, seems like easiest way is to run all tests in the file instead of including all deps in test cmd)
- If struct has implicit initialisation test cases won't show up, is there a solution to this?
- Create multiple different types of tests and get them working
- There is a bug to do with how privimatives are listening for key presses. Global keys require to be pressed twice??
- go test on a file with a failing test case does not run the test?? This is the same behaviour as running go test -run filename. Look at alternative ways

This Branch:
1. Update TUI tree to gen from data tree
2. logging from ctx
3. Make sure sizing can be changed for tree panel
4. Remove pkg and rename pkg2 -> pkg


- Adjust config temporarily
- Custom themes
- Add results state to test in tree (tick or cross emoji??)
- Add a helper modal that shows all keybindings (for current panel)
- Create my own test result parser??
- Add focus to results 
  - search 
  - scroll
  - copy 
- Optimize with concurrency
- File test (needs a deep dive, seems like easiest way is to run all tests in the file instead of including all deps in test cmd)
- Create multiple different types of tests and get them working -> t.Run("static", ...)
- If struct has implicit initialisation test cases won't show up, is there a solution to this?
- take config logic and make it a seperate project with clearer code and reusablity
- log by context

Bug:
# - go test on a file with a failing test case does not run the test?? This is the same behaviour as running go test -run filename. Look at alternative ways
- add tmux support to readme -> COLORTERM=truecolor
- add dynamic sizing for tree??
- fzf case sensitive should be insenseitive -> clean input
- H should close current level and select one above
- gg + G page scroll
- config pane is transparent
- console should have drop down for each large field (outputs and errors)
- What happens if you hit run too many times? How to control ongoing tests.. only one in flight?
- There is a bug to do with how privimatives are listening for key presses. Global keys require to be pressed twice??

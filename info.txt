TODO: 
- theming
- logging
- update keymaps (scroll, rerun, ...)
- add package scope (might look like a folder between project and file)
- search (this should have a map from a from search term to struct with a ref to the node and other meta data) 
  - use fzf
- rerun last
- Option to rescan for tests / should this happen on a timer??
- Create/modify config in app
- smaller results panel below results that has meta data and logs??
  - test name
  - file location
  - pass / fail
- some ui impovement to change screen when rerunning test
- add config option to set how many levels you want displayed before filename
- add results state to test in tree (tick or cross emoji??)
- add switch focus to results 
  - search 
  - scroll
  - copy 

Notes
- Check if it might make more sence to call go test package instead of using os.exec
- check if a tparse integration works better than piping (piping can be made nicer later)

TODO: 
Convert this text to github project

5. Config form for runtime adjusting (use table with three columns?)
6. Readme
7. Move to public
8. Version

Required:
- search should fuzzy find fzf + ctrl jk for nav + themed suggestions
- add pop up config display (Needs a form for runtime altering)
- test file fix

Nice to have: 
- File test (needs a deep dive, seems like easiest way is to run all tests in the file instead of including all deps in test cmd)
- create reusable components 
  -> search (an input field just for searching with keymap flexibility)
  -> page system / page structure (how should each page interact? home page? panels within a page?, keybind display)

- parsing of my own -> strip unused text -> color important parts (highlight filepath -> good for finding where a panic happened)

- custom themes

- add results state to test in tree (tick or cross emoji??) -> this does not persist longer than the session

- add a helper modal that shows all keybindings

- add switch focus to results 
  - search 
  - scroll
  - copy 

- optimize with concurrency

Bug:
- If you have three tests named -> TestAdd, TestAddSuccess and TestAddFail. Running TestAdd will run all of them. Specific regex needed
- If struct has implicit initialisation test cases won't show up, is there a solution to this?
- Create multiple different types of tests and get them working
- TODOs in code
- There is a bug to do with how privimatives are listening for key presses. Global keys require to be pressed twice??
- go test on a file with a failing test case does not run the test?? This is the same behaviour as running go test -run filename. Look at alternative ways

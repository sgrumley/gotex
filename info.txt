TODO: 
Once the project has required tasks and bugs completed -> clean code -> update pkg code to be an api -> write readme

Required:
- logging
- search (this should have a map from a from search term to struct with a ref to the node and other meta data) 
  - fzf
- Option to rescan for tests / should this happen on a timer??
- smaller results panel below results that has meta data and logs??
  - test name
  - file location
  - pass / fail
- add switch focus to results 
  - search 
  - scroll
  - copy 

Nice to have: 
- theming
- add package scope (might look like a folder between project and file)
- Create/modify config in app (this should be stateless, modify yaml for persistent settings)
- add config option to set how many levels you want displayed before filename
- add results state to test in tree (tick or cross emoji??) -> this does not persist longer than the session

Bug:
- file tree panel doesn't scale well. Results should scale with filetree fixed
- some ui impovement to change screen when rerunning test
- update keymaps help text (scroll, rerun, ...)
- file tests don't work in some projects
- large projects fail in finding tests 
- some test cases are showing up incorrectly

Notes
- Check if it might make more sence to call go test package instead of using os.exec
- check if a tparse integration works better than piping (piping can be made nicer later)
- optimize with concurrency
